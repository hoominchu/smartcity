    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <div id="about-project">
        <p>This project aims at creating software that helps make sense of the data being collected by Hubli-Dharwad
            Municipal Corporation. It will help bring transparency in the system by making all the information available
            to
            public in an easily understandable format. This will also help smoothen processes in the offices by letting
            people access information easily.</p>

        <p>This project has two main components. The first component of the project is to build tools for administrators
            and local political leaders which help in making better decisions. For example, the commissioner of HDMC
            will be
            able to look at the dashboard to get information about ward wise expenditure, number of works in progress,
            total
            amount of funds, funds already used up and so on. With the help of maps he/she can get a clear picture of
            where
            the work is being done. The commissioner can also monitor the works by checking the images submitted by the
            contractors and see if the citizens are satisfied by looking at their comments on the works.</p>

        <p>Second component aims at making this a portal for Hubli-Dharwad citizens to track what is happening around
            them
            in them in the city. This will help people in becoming more responsible and participate actively in the
            development of their city. The contact information of the corporators/concerned persons will also be made
            public
            and easily accessible. It will be of great help if any citizen, who experiences inconvenience due to some
            civic
            work going on in his/her area, can get to know the details of the work such as who is the contractor, when
            should it be completed, how much is the amount sanctioned for the project and so on. People can also comment
            on
            any work and discuss about it with fellow citizens thus creating a productive social network space.
